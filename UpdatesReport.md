Update 04/04/21 by Aurelien :
We were told to write our scripts in English, so I don't know if we are also expected to write in english our reports. Finally, I got GithubDesktop, VisualStudioCode and Python to work. It was much harder than expected but it works now.

I completed the step 1) of the worksheet. I plotted the graph with two different styles. The first one is a histogram and the second one a dotted line. I thought the second one could be more visual than the first one.

I used pandas in order to complete the histogram (bar plot).

I have also tried to get a fitting curve of the exponential decay, by using the polynomial tool polyfit. I managed to get the graph but the approximation wasn't great, even with a degree equal to 100. Nevertheless, I understood it was normal considering that there is more than 1000 values in the x-axis. I had tried to get a fitting curve because I thought it have been more visual than a histogram but, eventually, the red dotted line returns the same thing.

That's basically what I did today.
